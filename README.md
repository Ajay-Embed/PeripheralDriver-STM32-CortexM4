# PeripheralDriver-STM32-CortexM4
Peripheral drivers developed on top of CMSIS. Some of them are GPIO, SPI, UART, DMA, USB-HID Mouse, USB-HID Keyboard, Timer, ADC etc.

1. The projects are built on-top of CMSIS abstraction

2. The projects can be cloned and the folder can be created as a new workspace.

3. IDE - STM32CubeIDE. Atollic, SW4STM32 could also compile, some minor changes are required for KEIL ARM-MDK or EWARM.

4. The project is not well commented or refactored at this point in time, it will be done soon as the mentioned topics are completed & uploaded.
